# What Is React?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

### Variable declaration
ES6 introduced the let keyword, which allows for block-scoped variables which cannot be hoisted or redeclared.

### Constant declaration
ES6 introduced the const keyword, which cannot be redeclared or reassigned, but is not immutable.

### Arrow functions
The arrow function expression syntax is a shorter way of creating a function expression. Arrow functions do not have their own this, do not have prototypes, cannot be used for constructors, and should not be used as object methods.

### Implicit returns
The return keyword is implied and can be omitted if using arrow functions without a block body.

### Method definition shorthand
The function keyword can be omitted when assigning methods on an object.

### Destructuring (object matching)
Use curly brackets to assign properties of an object to their own variable.

### Array iteration (looping)
A more concise syntax has been introduced for iteration through arrays and other iterable objects.

### Default parameters
Functions can be initialized with default parameters, which will be used only if an argument is not invoked through the function.

### Spread syntax
Spread syntax can be used to expand an array.

### Classes/constructor functions
ES6 introducess the class syntax on top of the prototype-based constructor function.

### Inheritance
The extends keyword creates a subclass.

### Modules - export/import
Modules can be created to export and import code between files.

### Promises/Callbacks
Promises represent the completion of an asynchronous function. They can be used as an alternative to chaining functions.
