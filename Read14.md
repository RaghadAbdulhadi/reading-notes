# Matplotlib
matplotlib is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats
Matplotlib comes with a set of default settings that allow customizing all kinds of properties. You can control the defaults of almost every property in matplotlib: figure size and dpi, line width, color and style, axes, axis and grid properties, text and font properties and so on. While matplotlib defaults are rather good in most cases, you may want to modify some properties for specific cases.
## IPython
IPython is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging and much more. It allows interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functionality.
## pyplot
pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments.

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.plot(data)
