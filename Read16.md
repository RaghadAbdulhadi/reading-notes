# Serverless
Serverless is a cloud execution model that enables a simpler, more cost-effective way to build and operate cloud-native applications.

## What is serverless?
Serverless is a cloud computing execution model that:

- Automatically provisions the computing resources required to run application code on demand, or in response to a specific event
- Automatically scales those resources up or down in response to increased or decreased demand
- Automatically scales resources to zero when the application stops running



## Serverless pros and cons

### Pros
- Gives developers more time to develop and optimize their front-end application code and business logic.
- Serverless customers pay for execution only
- Serverless is a polyglot environment, enabling developers to code in any language or framework with which they're comfortable.
- Serverless simplifies deployment and, in a larger sense, simplifies DevOps cycles, because developers don't have to describe infrastructure needed integrate, test, deliver and deploy code builds into production.
- Serverless can be both faster and more cost-effective than other forms of compute.
- Serverless application development platforms provide near-total visibility into system and user times, and can aggregate that information systematically.

### Cons
*There are certain applications for which serverless is not favorable, or which present technical and business trade-offs to consider:*
- Stable or predictable workloads
- Cold starts
- Monitoring and debugging
- Vendor lock-in
