# Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

> PUSH YOUR SELF OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE!

**Software Development** is not about instructions or guidelines you should follow to be successful, its all about continuously searching, learning new things, experiencing new challenges.

A software developer that is facing the same issues, errors, or problems every time is not about the improvement of the technical skills. To improve the technical skills than a one has new challenges should be experienced, going through complicated errors or problems and reach out the solution for them is all about development of yourself in the feild.

When going through a specific challenge with a hard work and many times of failing to solve it, will be leading you to the correct way of learning and improving yourself, and finally reaching to your solution, try sending your solution to others, take a feedback from them, negative feedback or comments will grow your code to be more clean, organized, with the correct logic. Going through others errors and solutions can be also helpful for you to experience more than one way of solving one problem.

> IF YOU ARE NOT EXHAUSTED AFTER A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE, YOU ARE NOT LEARNING NEW THINGS!

TRY: 
- Always challenge yourself with problems that can't be solved quickly or requires all your thinking and concentration, you should search, try, fail, get exhausted to reach to the desired solution.
- Link your skills to real world problems.
- Keep on reaching new coding languages, new skills, new techniques and new challenges to get to the right place.
